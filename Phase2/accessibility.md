#Project Accessibility Report

###1.For each Principle of Universal Design, write 2-5 sentences or point form notes explaining which features your program adhere to that principle. If you do not have any such features you can either:
###(a) Describe features that you could implement in the future that would adhere to principle OR
####Principle 1: Equitable Use
There is privacy and security for all users since a password is used. A security program could be used along-side to prevent hacks.
Patients and staff both use a similar user interface with only a difference in access permissions. Since each user can only view 
and sign into their own types of account, confidentiality of patient personal information is kept.
####Principle 3: Simple and Intuitive Use
Uses descriptive titles and provides explanations for every input needed. Examples of the format of expected text
is given when needed.
Language used accommodates a wide range of literacy skills and in the future, a translation program could be implemented 
so the program can be run in different languages.
####Principle 4: Perceptible Information
Could implement the use of large text size with contrasting text and background color for ease of reading and good legibility.
Could implement more presenters in the future to make the program more visually appealing and implement ways to upload 
and display medical images.
####Principle 5: Tolerance for Error
Input errors are not easily tolerated since they may crash the system but an explanation is given when an input fails.
Could implement more fail safes for inputs so that system does not crash as easily.
Only one user command line hence minimal elements that can cause error.
####Principle 6: Low Physical Effort
No physical effort needed and allows user to maintain a neutral body position.

###(b) Explain why the principle does not apply to a program like yours.
####Principle 2: Flexibility in Use
Our program runs on a computer hence there is not much flexibility in use however
the user can use the interface at their own pace.
Accuracy and precision is also not needed as inputs are typed in.
####Principle 7: Size and Space for Approach and Use
Our program runs on a computer hence it can be accessible or not depending on where the computer is placed and
depends on whether a desktop or laptop is used.

###2.Write a paragraph about who you would market your program towards, if you were to sell or license your program to customers. This could be a specific category such as "students" or more vague, such as "people who like games". Try to give a bit more detail along with the category.
The program would be marketed towards hospitals that require a system to keep track of staff and patients.
The program would be licensed and the hospital would pay a fee to use the system every year (yearly subscription).

###3.Write a paragraph about whether or not your program is less likely to be used by certain demographics. For example, a program that converts txt files to files that can be printed by a braille printer are less likely to be used by people who do not read braille.
The program would less likely be used by hospitals that only have disabled or elderly patients as it would be very difficult
for such patients to type into a computer.
