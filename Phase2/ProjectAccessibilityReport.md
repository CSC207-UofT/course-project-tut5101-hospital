#Project Accessibility Report

##1.For each Principle of Universal Design, write 2-5 sentences or point form notes explaining which features your program adhere to that principle. If you do not have any such features you can either:
###(a) Describe features that you could implement in the future that would adhere to principle OR
####Principle 1: Equitable Use
There is privacy and security for all users since a password is used.
Patients and staff both use a similar user interface with only a difference in access permissions.
####Principle 3: Simple and Intuitive Use
Uses descriptive titles and provides explanations for every input needed.
####Principle 4: Perceptible Information
Uses large text size with contrasting text and background color for ease of reading and good legibility.
####Principle 5: Tolerance for Error
Input errors are easily tolerated and an explanation is given when an input fails. 
Only one user command line hence minimal elements that can cause error.
####Principle 6: Low Physical Effort
No physical effort needed and allows user to maintain a neutral body position.

###(b) Explain why the principle does not apply to a program like yours.
####Principle 2: Flexibility in Use
Our program runs on a computer hence there is not much flexibility in use however
the user can use the interface at their own pace. 
Accuracy and precision is also not needed as inputs are typed in.
####Principle 7: Size and Space for Approach and Use
Our program runs on a computer hence it can be accessible or not depending on where the computer is placed and 
depends on whether a desktop or laptop is used.

##2.Write a paragraph about who you would market your program towards, if you were to sell or license your program to customers. This could be a specific category such as "students" or more vague, such as "people who like games". Try to give a bit more detail along with the category.

##3.Write a paragraph about whether or not your program is less likely to be used by certain demographics. For example, a program that converts txt files to files that can be printed by a braille printer are less likely to be used by people who do not read braille.
